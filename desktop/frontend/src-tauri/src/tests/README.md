## Test Architecture and Patterns

### Mock Implementations
Each test module includes comprehensive mock implementations that:
- Simulate real component behavior without external dependencies
- Provide controllable test environments
- Enable isolated unit testing
- Support concurrent operation testing

### Testing Patterns Used
1. **Async/Await Testing**: All tests use `#[tokio::test]` for async operations
2. **Thread Safety**: Tests verify concurrent access patterns with Arc/Mutex
3. **Error Path Testing**: Comprehensive error condition coverage
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
5. **State Validation**: Verification of internal state consistency
6. **Resource Cleanup**: Testing of proper resource management

### Key Testing Principles Applied
1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't affect others
2. **Repeatability**: Tests produce consistent results across runs
3. **Coverage**: Both happy path and error scenarios are tested
4. **Concurrency**: Thread safety is validated through concurrent operations
5. **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked to enable unit testing
6. **Validation**: All assertions verify expected behavior precisely

## Running the Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
cd /home/svnbjrn/code/cl1/MDMAI/desktop/frontend/src-tauri
cargo test
```
