# Task 18.3: Real-time Features - Requirements Specification

## Business Requirements

### User Stories
1. **As a Game Master**, I want to see when players are actively typing or drawing, so I can coordinate better during sessions.
2. **As a Player**, I want to see other players' cursors on shared maps, so we can collaborate on tactical planning.
3. **As a User**, I want real-time updates without page refresh, so the game flow isn't interrupted.
4. **As a Session Host**, I want to know when users disconnect/reconnect, so I can pause if needed.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can see who is currently online in their session
- [ ] Cursor positions update within 100ms for all users
- [ ] Drawing on canvas syncs in real-time (< 200ms latency)
- [ ] Activity feed shows last 50 events
- [ ] System handles 20+ concurrent users per session
- [ ] Automatic reconnection after network interruption
- [ ] Graceful fallback when WebSocket unavailable

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **WebSocket Connection Management**
   - Establish secure WebSocket connections
   - Implement heartbeat mechanism (30s interval)
   - Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
   - Message queuing during disconnection

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
   - One-way server-to-client communication
   - Event filtering by type
   - Last-Event-ID support for recovery
   - Automatic reconnection

3. **Collaborative Canvas**
   - Support pen, eraser, shapes tools
   - Undo/redo with history limit (50 operations)
   - Layer management (background, tokens, drawings)
   - Grid overlay toggle (5ft squares for D&D)

4. **Presence System**
   - Online/Away/Offline status
   - Last seen timestamps
   - Activity indicators (typing, drawing, idle)
   - Cursor position tracking

5. **Activity Feed**
   - Real-time event stream
   - Event categorization and filtering
   - Timestamp and user attribution
   - Pagination for history

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: < 100ms latency for cursor updates
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ concurrent sessions
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for WebSocket service
- **Security**: TLS encryption, JWT authentication
- **Compatibility**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+

## Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies
- [ ] WebSocket server implementation (src/bridge/)
- [ ] SSE endpoint in FastAPI
- [ ] Session management system
- [ ] Authentication middleware
- [ ] Message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ)

### Frontend Dependencies
- [ ] SvelteKit SSR configuration
- [ ] TypeScript types for messages
- [ ] Existing collaboration store
- [ ] UI component library (bits-ui)

### External Dependencies
- [ ] SSL certificates for WSS
- [ ] Load balancer with sticky sessions
- [ ] CDN for static assets

## Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices
1. **Why WebSocket + SSE?**
   - WebSocket for bidirectional (drawing, cursor)
   - SSE for unidirectional (activity feed)
   - Fallback strategy for compatibility

2. **State Management**
   - Svelte stores for local state
   - Server as source of truth
   - Optimistic UI updates

3. **Message Format**
   - JSON for simplicity
   - Consider Protocol Buffers for v2
   - Compression for large payloads

### Trade-offs
- **Complexity vs Features**: Starting with basic tools, add advanced later
- **Real-time vs Consistency**: Favor responsiveness with eventual consistency
- **Memory vs Speed**: Cache recent operations for fast undo/redo

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| WebSocket connection issues | High | Medium | SSE fallback, polling as last resort |
| State synchronization conflicts | Medium | High | Operational transformation, conflict resolution |
| Performance degradation at scale | High | Medium | Load testing, horizontal scaling ready |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Low | Polyfills, feature detection |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security audit, penetration testing |

## Definition of Done

### Development Complete When:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation written
- [ ] No critical bugs

### Ready for Testing When:
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Test data prepared
- [ ] QA test plan ready
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] Monitoring configured

## Estimated Effort

| Component | Backend | Frontend | Testing | Total |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| WebSocket Client | 8h | 16h | 8h | 32h |
| SSE Implementation | 8h | 12h | 4h | 24h |
| Collaborative Canvas | 4h | 24h | 8h | 36h |
| Presence System | 4h | 8h | 4h | 16h |
| Activity Feed | 4h | 8h | 4h | 16h |
| Integration | 8h | 8h | 8h | 24h |
| **Total** | **36h** | **76h** | **36h** | **148h** |

## Questions to Resolve

1. Should we use a message broker (Redis pub/sub) from the start?
2. What's the maximum canvas size and number of objects?
3. How long should activity history be retained?
4. Should cursor positions be throttled or sent immediately?
5. What happens when session owner disconnects?

## Spike Tasks Needed

- [ ] POC: WebSocket scaling with 100+ connections
- [ ] POC: Canvas performance with 1000+ objects
- [ ] POC: Conflict resolution algorithm
- [ ] Research: WebRTC for P2P option
- [ ] Benchmark: JSON vs Protocol Buffers
