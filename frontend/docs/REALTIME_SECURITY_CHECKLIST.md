# Real-time Features Security Checklist

## Pre-Production Security Audit

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] WebSocket connections require valid JWT tokens
- [ ] SSE endpoints validate session cookies
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism implemented
- [ ] Session timeout handling in place
- [ ] Role-based access control enforced
- [ ] Cross-origin requests properly configured

### Input Validation
- [ ] Message size limits enforced (recommend 64KB max)
- [ ] Message type validation on server
- [ ] Sanitization of user-generated content
- [ ] SQL injection prevention for any database queries
- [ ] XSS protection for displayed messages
- [ ] Path traversal prevention in file operations

### Rate Limiting & DoS Protection
- [ ] Connection rate limiting per IP
- [ ] Message rate limiting per user (100/min recommended)
- [ ] Cursor update throttling (60Hz max)
- [ ] Drawing operation debouncing
- [ ] Maximum concurrent connections per user
- [ ] Resource cleanup on disconnect

### Data Protection
- [ ] TLS/SSL for all connections (wss://, https://)
- [ ] Sensitive data never logged
- [ ] PII properly handled and encrypted
- [ ] Message history retention policies
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] Secure credential storage

### Error Handling
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages
- [ ] Graceful degradation on failures
- [ ] Proper error logging without exposing internals
- [ ] Client-side error recovery
- [ ] Server-side error boundaries

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Connection anomaly detection
- [ ] Unusual traffic pattern alerts
- [ ] Failed authentication monitoring
- [ ] Resource usage tracking
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Latency threshold alerts

## Vulnerability Testing

### Common Attack Vectors to Test
1. **WebSocket Hijacking**
   - [ ] Test CSRF token validation
   - [ ] Verify origin header checking
   - [ ] Test session fixation

2. **Message Injection**
   - [ ] Test malicious JavaScript in messages
   - [ ] Test SQL injection attempts
   - [ ] Test command injection

3. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - [ ] Test rapid connection/disconnection
   - [ ] Test message flooding
   - [ ] Test large message payloads
   - [ ] Test memory leaks

4. **Authentication Bypass**
   - [ ] Test expired token handling
   - [ ] Test modified JWT signatures
   - [ ] Test privilege escalation

## Performance Security

### Resource Limits
- [ ] Maximum WebSocket connections: 10,000
- [ ] Maximum SSE connections: 5,000
- [ ] Message queue size limit: 1000 per client
- [ ] Memory usage cap per connection
- [ ] CPU throttling for expensive operations

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Horizontal scaling ready (Redis pub/sub)
- [ ] Load balancer sticky sessions configured
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Connection draining on deploy
- [ ] State recovery after restart

## Compliance & Privacy

### GDPR/Privacy Requirements
- [ ] User consent for data processing
- [ ] Data deletion capability
- [ ] Data export functionality
- [ ] Privacy policy updated
- [ ] Cookie consent for SSE

### Audit Logging
- [ ] Connection events logged
- [ ] Authentication attempts logged
- [ ] Critical actions logged
- [ ] Log retention policy defined
- [ ] Log access controls in place

## Code Review Focus Areas

### Frontend
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies)
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Subresource integrity for CDN assets
- [ ] Environment variable usage

### Backend
- [ ] Parameterized queries only
- [ ] Prepared statements for database
- [ ] Secret management system used
- [ ] Dependencies security scanned
- [ ] Docker image vulnerability scan

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Authorization checks tests
- [ ] Input validation tests
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Reconnection logic tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end encryption tests
- [ ] Cross-origin request tests
- [ ] Load balancing tests
- [ ] Failover scenario tests
- [ ] State synchronization tests

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] Professional pen test scheduled
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 checklist
- [ ] WebSocket-specific tests
- [ ] SSE-specific tests
