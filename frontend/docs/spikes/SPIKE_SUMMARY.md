# Spike Summary: Task 18.3 Real-time Features

## Overview
All 10 spike tasks have been completed to resolve unknowns and technical challenges for implementing real-time features in the TTRPG MCP Server. This document summarizes key findings and recommendations.

## Completed Spikes

### ✅ Spike 1: WebSocket Implementation
**Key Decision**: Enhanced Bridge Service Architecture
- Leverage existing bridge server at `/src/bridge/bridge_server.py`
- Implement WebSocket-to-MCP protocol translation
- Session management with connection pooling
- JWT-based authentication for web clients

### ✅ Spike 2: State Synchronization
**Key Decision**: Hybrid Event Sourcing + CRDT
- Event sourcing for audit trails and rollback
- CRDTs for conflict-free collaboration
- 3-tier state hierarchy (Campaign/Session/User)
- ChromaDB for semantic conflict resolution

### ✅ Spike 3: Authentication & Security
**Key Decision**: Dual-mode Authentication
- Local mode: Direct stdin/stdout (no auth)
- Web mode: JWT with refresh tokens
- Role-based access (GM/Player/Spectator)
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data

### ✅ Spike 4: Performance Requirements
**Key Targets**:
- PDF processing: 2-30 seconds
- Search latency: P50 <50ms, P95 <200ms
- WebSocket: 5000 msg/sec capacity
- Concurrent users: 20/session, 2000 total

### ✅ Spike 5: Offline Support
**Key Features**:
- Service worker with intelligent caching
- IndexedDB for campaign data
- Local dice rolling and initiative
- Background sync with conflict resolution

### ✅ Spike 6: Third-party Integration
**Supported Platforms**:
- D&D Beyond (character import)
- Roll20 (API integration)
- Foundry VTT (module)
- Discord bot
- OBS overlays

### ✅ Spike 7: Database & Storage
**Architecture**:
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- SQLite for structured data
- Redis for caching
- Multi-level cache strategy

### ✅ Spike 8: Error Recovery
**Strategies**:
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Session recovery with checkpoints

### ✅ Spike 9: Testing Strategy
**Coverage Targets**:
- Overall: 80% minimum
- Critical paths: 95%
- Test pyramid: 70% unit, 25% integration, 5% E2E
- Performance testing with Locust

### ✅ Spike 10: Browser Support
**Minimum Versions**:
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14.1+
- Progressive enhancement strategy
- Polyfills for missing features
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Enhanced MCP Tools Specification

A comprehensive set of 30+ MCP tools has been specified to support TTRPG sessions:

### Core Tools (Enhanced)
- `search_rules`: Hybrid search with campaign context
- `roll_dice`: Advanced modifiers and history
- `get_monster`: Party scaling and tactics
- `manage_initiative`: Conditions and delays
- `take_notes`: AI categorization and linking

### New Tools
- Combat automation (damage, conditions)
- Campaign management (timeline, resources, quests)
- Advanced generation (NPCs, locations, plots)
- Real-time collaboration (broadcast, sync)
- Session management (recap, planning)

## Technical Recommendations

### 1. Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Core WebSocket infrastructure and authentication
2. **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): State synchronization and conflict resolution
3. **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Offline support and third-party integrations
4. **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Performance optimization and error recovery

### 2. Architecture Decisions
- **Use existing bridge server** rather than building from scratch
- **Implement CRDT-based state sync** for real-time collaboration
- **JWT authentication** with role-based access control
- **Progressive enhancement** for browser compatibility
- **Event sourcing** for audit trails and rollback capability

### 3. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, FastMCP, ChromaDB, SQLite, Redis
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, TypeScript, IndexedDB, Service Workers
- **Real-time**: WebSocket with SSE and polling fallbacks
- **Testing**: Vitest, Pytest, Playwright, Locust

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Implement caching at multiple levels
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers and exponential backoff
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement and polyfills
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with session affinity

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2 Backend Engineers (Python, MCP)
- 2 Frontend Engineers (Svelte, TypeScript)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (Infrastructure, CI/CD)
- 1 QA Engineer (Testing, Performance)

### Infrastructure
- **Development**: Local Docker environment
- **Staging**: Kubernetes cluster (4 nodes)
- **Production**: Auto-scaling cluster (8-16 nodes)
- **CDN**: CloudFlare for static assets
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 8 weeks
- **MVP**: 4 weeks (core features)
- **Production Ready**: 8 weeks (all features + hardening)

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- ✅ Sub-200ms search latency (P95)
- ✅ <3s page load time
- ✅ 99.9% uptime
- ✅ Support for 20 concurrent users per session

### User Experience
- ✅ Offline capability for core features
- ✅ Real-time sync within 100ms
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Quality
- ✅ 80% test coverage
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ <1% error rate in production
- ✅ Automated deployment pipeline

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve spike findings** with stakeholders
2. **Create detailed implementation tasks** from spike recommendations
3. **Set up development environment** with Docker and dependencies
4. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** (WebSocket infrastructure)
5. **Establish monitoring and metrics** collection

## Conclusion

The spike research has successfully resolved all major technical unknowns for implementing real-time features in the TTRPG MCP Server. The recommended architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation that supports both local Claude Desktop usage and web-based multiplayer sessions.

Task 18.3 is now **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** with clear technical direction, resolved dependencies, and comprehensive implementation guidance.
