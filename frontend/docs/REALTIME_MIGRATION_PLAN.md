# Real-time Features Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the migration strategy for moving Task 18.3 Real-time Features from PLANNED to PRODUCTION.

## Pre-Migration Checklist

### Code Readiness
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] WebSocket servers provisioned
- [ ] Load balancers configured
- [ ] SSL certificates installed
- [ ] Monitoring setup complete
- [ ] Backup systems ready

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment (Week 1)
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Conduct QA testing
4. Fix any identified issues
5. Performance testing at scale

**Success Criteria:**
- All automated tests pass
- No critical bugs found
- Performance within 10% of targets
- Security scan clean

### Phase 2: Limited Beta (Week 2)
1. Enable for 5% of users
2. Monitor metrics closely
3. Collect user feedback
4. Address any issues
5. Gradual increase to 25%

**Monitoring Metrics:**
- Connection success rate > 99%
- Average latency < 100ms
- Error rate < 0.1%
- User satisfaction > 4/5

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Week 3-4)
```
Day 1-2:  25% → 50%
Day 3-4:  50% → 75%
Day 5-7:  75% → 100%
```

**Rollout Controls:**
- Feature flags per user segment
- A/B testing framework
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Automated rollback triggers

### Phase 4: Full Production (Week 5)
1. Remove feature flags
2. Optimize based on metrics
3. Document lessons learned
4. Plan future enhancements

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 1%
- P95 latency > 500ms
- Connection success < 95%
- Memory usage > 80%
- CPU usage > 70%

### Manual Rollback Procedure
```bash
# 1. Disable feature flag
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/flags/realtime-features \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'

# 2. Drain existing connections
kubectl rollout status deployment/websocket-server
kubectl scale deployment/websocket-server --replicas=0

# 3. Revert to previous version
git revert --no-commit <commit-hash>
git commit -m "Rollback: Real-time features to previous version"
git push origin main

# 4. Deploy previous version
kubectl set image deployment/frontend frontend=frontend:previous-version

# 5. Verify rollback
curl https://api.example.com/health
```

### Data Migration Rollback
```sql
-- Backup current state
CREATE TABLE realtime_backup AS SELECT * FROM realtime_data;

-- If rollback needed
DROP TABLE realtime_data;
ALTER TABLE realtime_backup RENAME TO realtime_data;
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **WebSocket Connection Storms**
   - Mitigation: Connection rate limiting
   - Rollback: Disable WebSocket, fall back to polling

2. **Memory Leaks**
   - Mitigation: Memory monitoring, auto-restart
   - Rollback: Scale down, investigate offline

3. **State Synchronization Issues**
   - Mitigation: Conflict resolution system
   - Rollback: Disable collaborative features

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Polyfills, fallback mechanisms
   - Response: Hot-fix for specific browsers

2. **Network Latency**
   - Mitigation: Regional servers, CDN
   - Response: Optimize message size

3. **Third-party Service Outages**
   - Mitigation: Fallback providers
   - Response: Graceful degradation

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- [ ] Engineering team briefing
- [ ] Support team training
- [ ] Operations runbook updated
- [ ] Executive summary prepared

### External Communication
- [ ] User announcement drafted
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Blog post prepared
- [ ] Support articles written

### Incident Response
1. **Detection:** Automated alerts + user reports
2. **Triage:** On-call engineer assessment
3. **Communication:** Status page update within 5 min
4. **Resolution:** Follow runbook or escalate
5. **Post-mortem:** Within 48 hours

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- WebSocket connection success rate: >99%
- Message delivery rate: >99.9%
- Average latency: <50ms (p50), <100ms (p95)
- Reconnection success rate: >95%
- Error rate: <0.1%

### Business Metrics
- User engagement increase: >20%
- Session duration increase: >15%
- Feature adoption rate: >60%
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5
- Support ticket reduction: >10%

## Post-Migration Tasks

### Week 1 After Migration
- [ ] Performance analysis report
- [ ] User feedback summary
- [ ] Bug triage and fixes
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Team retrospective

### Week 2-4 After Migration
- [ ] Optimization implementation
- [ ] Feature enhancements
- [ ] Capacity planning
- [ ] Cost analysis
- [ ] Security audit
