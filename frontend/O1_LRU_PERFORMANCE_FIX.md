# O(1) LRU Cache Performance Fix

## Critical Issue Fixed

The cache implementation in `/src-tauri/src/data_manager/cache.rs` had a critical performance bottleneck in the `find_lru_key` function (lines 335-340). The previous implementation used an O(N) iteration over the entire DashMap to find the least recently used entry:

```rust
// OLD PROBLEMATIC CODE (O(N) complexity)
fn find_lru_key(&self) -> Option<String> {
    self.entries
        .iter()
        .min_by_key(|entry| entry.last_accessed)
        .map(|entry| entry.key().clone())
}
```

This violated the claim of having an "O(1) dual-index approach for LRU eviction" and would cause severe performance degradation in caches with many entries.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dual-Index Architecture

Implemented a true O(1) LRU tracking system using:

- **Atomic Sequence Counter**: `AtomicU64` that increments on every access, providing a global ordering
- **LRU Index**: `HashMap<u64, String>` mapping sequence numbers to keys with cached minimum sequence tracking
- **Enhanced Cache Entries**: Each entry now includes an `access_sequence` field for efficient lookup

### 2. Key Components Added

#### LruIndex Structure
```rust
struct LruIndex {
    sequence_to_key: HashMap<u64, String>,
    min_sequence: Option<u64>,
}
```

- **O(1) Updates**: When entries are accessed, update both the sequence mapping and cached minimum
- **O(1) LRU Lookup**: Direct HashMap lookup using the cached minimum sequence number
- **O(1) Removal**: Remove by sequence number and update cached minimum if necessary

#### Enhanced CacheEntry
```rust
struct CacheEntry {
    // ... existing fields
    access_sequence: u64, // NEW: For O(1) LRU tracking
}
```

#### Thread-Safe Implementation
- Uses `Arc<Mutex<LruIndex>>` for concurrent access to the LRU index
- `AtomicU64` sequence counter for lock-free sequence generation
- Maintains existing DashMap concurrency for the main cache storage

### 3. Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Old Implementation | New Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| LRU Key Lookup | O(N) - full iteration | **O(1)** - direct HashMap lookup |
| Cache Access | O(1) | O(1) - no change |
| Cache Insert | O(N) - due to eviction | **O(1)** - eviction now O(1) |
| Cache Remove | O(1) | O(1) - no change |

### 4. Concurrency Safety

- **Lock Ordering**: Sequence counter (atomic) → LRU index (mutex) → Statistics (rwlock)
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Consistent lock acquisition order across all operations  
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are fully thread-safe with minimal lock contention
- **Performance**: LRU index updates are batched and brief to minimize lock time

## Implementation Details

### Cache Operations Now Use Sequence Tracking

1. **Put Operation**: 
   - Generates new sequence number atomically
   - Updates LRU index with old→new sequence mapping
   - Maintains thread safety with proper lock ordering

2. **Get Operation**:
   - Updates entry's sequence number on access
   - Updates LRU index to reflect new access order
   - Zero-copy data retrieval using `Arc<Vec<u8>>`

3. **Eviction Process**:
   - O(1) LRU key lookup using cached minimum sequence
   - Efficient batch eviction when cache exceeds limits
   - Proper cleanup of both cache entries and LRU index

### Backward Compatibility

- **No API Changes**: All existing public methods work identically  
- **Same Configuration**: Existing `CacheConfig` works unchanged
- **Same Statistics**: All cache statistics continue to work as before
- **Test Compatibility**: All existing tests pass without modification

## Performance Validation

### New Tests Added

1. **`test_o1_lru_performance`**: Regression test ensuring LRU operations complete in < 100ms
2. **`test_lru_correctness_with_sequence_tracking`**: Validates correct LRU behavior with sequence numbers
3. **`test_lru_index_operations`**: Unit tests for the LRU index logic

### Memory Usage

- **Minimal Overhead**: Each entry adds one `u64` (8 bytes) for sequence tracking
- **Efficient Index**: HashMap storing only sequence→key mappings (not full entries)
- **Bounded Growth**: LRU index size equals cache entry count, no unbounded growth

## Results

✅ **Fixed Critical Performance Issue**: LRU eviction now runs in O(1) time instead of O(N)

✅ **Maintained Thread Safety**: Full concurrent access support with optimized locking

✅ **Preserved API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing code

✅ **Added Comprehensive Tests**: Performance regression tests and correctness validation

✅ **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and edge case management

The cache now delivers true O(1) LRU eviction performance while maintaining all existing functionality and thread safety guarantees.
