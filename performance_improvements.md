# Performance Optimization Code Review Issues

## Issues Identified

### 1. Bare except clauses (Critical)
- **Location**: cache_system.py lines 445, 449
- **Issue**: Using bare `except:` catches all exceptions including SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt
- **Impact**: Can prevent proper shutdown and hide critical errors

### 2. Missing psutil dependency (Critical)
- **Location**: performance_monitor.py
- **Issue**: psutil is imported but not in requirements.txt
- **Impact**: Will cause ImportError in production

### 3. Thread safety issues (High)
- **Location**: Multiple files using threading and asyncio
- **Issue**: Mixing threading.Lock with asyncio code
- **Impact**: Potential deadlocks and race conditions

### 4. Unclosed ThreadPoolExecutor (High)
- **Location**: database_optimizer.py
- **Issue**: ThreadPoolExecutor not properly closed on shutdown
- **Impact**: Resource leak

### 5. Inefficient error handling (Medium)
- **Location**: Multiple generic Exception catches
- **Issue**: Too broad exception handling masks specific errors
- **Impact**: Harder debugging and potential missed errors

### 6. Missing type hints (Medium)
- **Location**: Several function parameters and returns
- **Issue**: Inconsistent type hints
- **Impact**: Reduced code clarity and IDE support

### 7. Performance monitoring overhead (Medium)
- **Location**: performance_monitor.py
- **Issue**: Continuous monitoring without throttling
- **Impact**: Can impact actual performance

### 8. Cache invalidation race conditions (High)
- **Location**: cache_invalidator.py
- **Issue**: No atomic operations for invalidation
- **Impact**: Stale data could be served

## Fixes Applied

1. Fixed bare except clauses with specific exception handling
2. Added psutil to requirements.txt
3. Improved thread safety with proper async/sync separation
4. Added proper cleanup for ThreadPoolExecutor
5. Replaced generic exception handling with specific exceptions
6. Added comprehensive type hints
7. Added throttling to performance monitoring
8. Implemented atomic cache invalidation operations
